# Leadership Effectiveness Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the effectiveness of leaders in an organizational setting. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various leadership metrics and predict whether a leader will be effective. The model is trained on a dataset generated using the faker library, encompassing features like team engagement, communication effectiveness, innovation index, and more.

## Features
The project includes:

## Data generation script using faker to create a synthetic dataset of leadership metrics.
Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Implementation of a logistic regression model for binary classification (Effective/Ineffective).
Prediction of leadership effectiveness and probability scoring.
Exporting the predicted data to a CSV file for further analysis.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Team Leader Name
Decision-Making Efficiency (days)
Team Engagement (score)
Communication Effectiveness (score)
Cultural Competency Metrics (score)
Innovation Index (score)
Workforce Analytics (score)
Leadership Development Tracking (score)
Employee Well-being Index (score)
Collaboration Network Analysis (score)
